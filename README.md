#### Description  
Rune is a Kanban project management tool designed as our team's senior capstone project. We've all worked with Jira in the past, and realize its importance for managing software development among large teams. Throughout our time at UCLA, we've participated in large software development groups where it's hard to keep track of what everyone's working on, and projects tend to stagnate until they turn into last-minute hackathon sessions. Thus it was our intention to create some sort of issue tracker for students, and we created Rune with these issues in mind.  
  
Rune promotes a Kanban workflow - You can create tasks for your project that can be placed in a backlog. When you or one of your teammates picks up a task, simply move it to a new state (Selected for Development, In Progress, Completed). You can also add comments to existing tasks, or associate completed tasks with Github commits.

<i>Six weeks into development, we started being able to use Rune to track our own project!</i>
